In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a simulation using classes and arrays. For the first part of the assignment, we created a simple bubble simulation. Then, we moved on to a more complicated breeder/catcher simulation, in which the breeder made copies of itself when it touched another sprite of it's kind, and the catcher destroyed any breeder it came into contact with.

Firstly, we made a small bubble simulation that jittered around. The link is here : https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/tT1Bpx-Wi

Then, we used a class of Bubble and an array to move all of the bubbles at once without having to call each of their show methods manually. We also increased the simulation size to 50 bubbles. The sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/c3dZi_TEn

For the second phase of this assignment, we turned our bubble simulation into a living catcher breeder sim. First I made all of the assets and programmed the particles, which in this case are twinkling stars. The link is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/ckv5k3eOl

Then, I made the breeders move and repopulate. The simulation gets out of hand quickly when there is nothing to reign the population in! The link is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/xKcT52wZK

Finally, I made the catchers move and destroy any breeders they come across. The simulation is also bigger with more entities. The link is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/gBrmSUU2X
